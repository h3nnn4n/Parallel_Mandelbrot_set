# Parallel Mandelbrot Set
==================

This is a very simple (at least for now) implementation of a parallel render for the mandelbrot set.
For now it works with OpenMP or threads. I plan to make a distribuited version using MPI.
The implementation is very simple for now, however I want to add more features.

## Features

1. It compiles
2. It runs
3. Block based optimization and cycle detection

## TODO

1. Colors
2. Arbitrary precision
3. A better TODO list
